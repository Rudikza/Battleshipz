So this is my battleship application. It's not complete but I thought I would add in as much as possible.

Todo:

* Logic to determine if a ship was hit or not.

* Figure out how to intercept the http request and detect if a ship was hit or not and send back results.

* Automated Logic to randomly fire at opponent excluding already fired shots.

* Ability for ships to be placed randomly.

* Ability for user to determine where to fire.

* Ability for user to place ships.
